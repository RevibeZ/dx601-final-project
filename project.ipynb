    "Below are brief descriptions for each column in the White_Wine_Quality dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fixed acidity`: Refers to the non-volatile acids in wine—mainly tartaric and malic acid—that do not evaporate easily. These acids influence the wine’s overall sourness, structure, and stability.\n",
    "- `volatile acidity`: Measures acids that can evaporate, mainly acetic acid (associated with vinegar smell). High values can lead to unpleasant vinegar-like aromas, so lower levels are preferred for quality.\n",
    "- `citric acid`: A weak acid naturally present in small amounts. Adds freshness, “brightness”, and enhances the wine’s flavor and aroma when present at moderate levels.\n",
    "- `residual sugar`: Amount of sugar left after fermentation (in g/L). Higher values indicate sweeter wines; lower values correspond to dry wines. White wines often vary widely in this measurement.\n",
    "- `chlorides`: Represents the amount of salt in the wine (mostly sodium chloride) (in g/L). High chloride levels can negatively affect taste.\n",
    "- `free sulfur dioxide`: SO2 that is not chemically bound (in mg/L)) and is available to act as an antimicrobial and antioxidant. Too much can impact aroma; too little may allow spoilage.\n",
    "- `total sulfur dioxide`: Total amount of SO2 (free + bound). High levels may affect smell/taste; low levels may harm preservation.\n",
    "- `density`: Liquid density (g/cm³); Density of the wine relative to water. Highly related to sugar and alcohol content: more sugar or less alcohol increases density.\n",
    "- `pH`: Acidity level of the wine, measured on the pH scale. Lower pH = more acidic, which influences taste, preservation, and color stability.\n",
    "- `sulphates`: Amount of potassium sulfate added, often used as a wine preservative. Linked to SO2 production, which affects freshness and microbial stability.\n",
    "- `alcohol`: Alcohol percentage by volume (% ABV). Generally, higher alcohol levels increase the wine's body, warmth, and often its quality rating.\n",
    "- `quality`: Our Target Variable! This is a sensory score assigned by trained wine experts. It represents an ordinal scale where 0 = very bad and 10 = excellent."
